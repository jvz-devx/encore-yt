# ytfast agent guide

ytfast is a native YouTube Music client for Omarchy (Linux): Rust + egui on [fastframe](https://github.com/crmne/fastframe), modelled on ZapFast and Spotifast. It has no browser engine, no telemetry and no server of its own. Shown to people as "Music".

## This fork: the GPUI frontend

This repository is jvz-devx/ytfast-gpui, a fork of MayberryDT/ytfast (remote `upstream`). It adds a GPUI interface in `gpui/` on the same backend. Read [docs/gpui/PLAN.md](docs/gpui/PLAN.md) first: it holds the milestones, how each is verified, and the log.

- The root crate's egui interface sits behind the default `egui` feature. The backend must keep building with `--no-default-features`, and the egui app must keep building too. Keep root-crate changes small and upstream-shaped so `git merge upstream/main` stays easy.
- `gpui/` is its own Cargo workspace (own `Cargo.lock`, own `target/`). It depends on the root crate with `default-features = false`.
- Platform for the GPUI app: Fedora, KDE Plasma on Wayland. The Omarchy rules below apply to the egui app; the GPUI app takes its colours from its own theme module, never hard-coded in views.
- Fixture-based parser tests (saved signed-out InnerTube responses) are allowed in this fork, as an exception to the "no unit tests" rule below.
- Verify UI work visually: run the app on the Wayland session and capture it with `spectacle` (see PLAN.md). Don't claim a view works without looking at a capture.
- Commit in small topical commits on `main` and push to `origin`. Never push to `upstream`.

## Start here

1. [docs/SPEC.md](docs/SPEC.md): the product: journeys, decisions, exclusions. Don't redefine it from the code.
2. [docs/integration.md](docs/integration.md): verified cookie, InnerTube and stream facts, the chosen design, and how the E2E runs work. Read it before touching sign-in, playback or the build.
3. If a `notes/` directory exists, it's the maintainer's private notes (gitignored). Read `notes/AGENTS.md` first and follow it as well.

## Rules

- Cookie values and the Chromium cookie key are secrets. Never log, print or commit them; derived cookie files are 0600 and short-lived. Read the browser's cookie store read-only and never restart or modify the browser.
- Nothing from a real account goes into the repository: no captured responses, screenshots or logs with account data. E2E artifacts stay in the gitignored `artifacts/`. Public screenshots come from the signed-out `showcase` scenario, public videos from `scripts/demo.sh` (also signed out).
- Colours come only from the Omarchy theme palette. Never hard-code colours.
- Don't vendor or patch upstream crates here. Keep the egui/winit fork pins and the fastframe tag aligned with ZapFast/Spotifast and move them together.
- Tests: prefer E2E through the real app (`scripts/e2e.sh`), producing a repeatable artifact under `artifacts/`. No unit tests written after the code, and no tautological tests.
- `cargo fmt --all --check` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --features e2e -- -D warnings` must pass. Release builds are heavy (several minutes, a few GB of memory); cap them on small machines.

## UI copy

- Use YouTube Music's own labels for familiar places: Home, Explore, Library, Up next, Lyrics, Related, Quick picks, Listen again.
- Plain and short, sentence case. Say what happened and the one thing to do: "Signed out of YouTube Music" with Reconnect, not "Authentication error (401)".
- No exclamation marks or cleverness in errors. Technical detail (itag, codec, error text) goes behind a Copy button or in Settings.
- Never claim a state that wasn't checked, for example "Signed in" before an account request has succeeded.
