//! Changes to the signed-in account: likes and dislikes, saving albums and
//! playlists to the library, subscriptions, and the account's own playlists
//! (docs/integration.md, "Account changes").
//!
//! Every change shows in the frame of the input: the app shows the new state
//! (or edits the cached pages), then the backend asks YouTube Music, one
//! write at a time in the order asked. If YouTube Music refuses, the app
//! goes back to the newest change still on its way, or to what YouTube Music
//! last said, and a plain message says so. A few seconds after a change
//! succeeds, the pages it affects are fetched again; YouTube Music takes up
//! to ~3 s to show some changes, so for a while the app's own state wins
//! over what a fetched page says.
//!
//! # Using it from a frontend
//!
//! All of this lives on [`AccountState`], which a frontend keeps one of. It
//! never touches the frontend directly: each call takes a [`Host`] that
//! lends it the frontend's page cache (a `HashMap` from [`Target::key`] to
//! any type implementing [`CachedPage`]), a function that sends backend
//! [`Command`]s, and whether the account is signed in. Each call returns
//! [`Effects`]: pages to fetch again (`refetch`, always forced), then plain
//! messages for the error strip. Carry them out in that order.
//!
//! - Interface input → [`AccountState::act`] with an [`AccountAction`]. It
//!   updates [`AccountState::marks`] (likes, library state, subscriptions as
//!   shown) or edits the cached pages in place, and sends
//!   `Command::AccountEdit`; a `Dialog` action only sets
//!   [`AccountState::dialog`]. Before deleting the playlist on screen, leave
//!   its page ([`playlist_keys`] tells which keys show it).
//! - `Event::AccountEdited { op, result }` → [`AccountState::edited`].
//! - `Event::Likes(likes)` → [`AccountState::likes_fetched`].
//! - `Event::AccountRefresh(targets)` → [`AccountState::refresh`].
//! - A page (`Event::Page`, saved or fresh) stored in the cache →
//!   [`AccountState::page_arrived`]; more rows of a page stored →
//!   [`AccountState::more_arrived`]. Call them after the cache holds the new
//!   copy: they apply the page changes still in force to it and may finish
//!   a move that waited for the next rows (which sends `Command::More`
//!   through [`CachedPage::start_more`]).
//!
//! Views read [`Marks::like`], [`Marks::saved`] and [`Marks::subscribed`]
//! from [`AccountState::marks`] (an `Arc`, cheap to hand out each frame),
//! [`own_playlists`] and [`playlist_title`] for the Add to playlist dialog,
//! and [`AccountState::busy`] while writes are on their way.
