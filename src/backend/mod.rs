//! The interface's handle to a tokio runtime that does all I/O: InnerTube,
//! the browser session, stream resolving and the audio engine. The two sides talk only through
//! [`Command`] (interface → backend) and [`Event`] (backend → interface);
//! every event wakes the window.
//!
//! Playback state belongs to the worker. Results of asynchronous work carry
//! the stamp they were started under, so a late answer never acts on newer
//! state: `generation` changes with the current track, `epoch` with the
//! queue (each play request), and the player's playlist entry ids tell the
//! current file's events from those of replaced or queued ones. Several
//! players (decks of the audio engine, see [`crate::player`]) can run at once (Smooth mixes, Audition: see
//! [`deck`]); their events carry the deck's serial and reach its current
//! role.
